# Peopleware
Peopleware by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister is a book about managing software teams and perhaps also managing knowledge workers.
The authors were interested in writing books about management because they experienced a lot of mismanaged teams themselves. They chose to write a management book about a different subject than most management books, that is, about the people instead of methodologies and techniques.

The book is extremely easy to read through. Each of the 39 chapters are short, direct and focused on one particular aspect. As mentioned above, the book focuses on the people and as an employee in a knowledge company I can definitely see the parallels between the principle espoused in the book and my own work life. The principles, when read, are so simple and obvious that you start seeing their applications or lack of application everywhere. There's plenty of more actionable lessons to take away from this book as well and in my opinion is a must read for every manager.

Few books in the software field has the potential to become classics due to the changing nature of software engineering. By focusing on the people instead of the technologies, Peopleware has already become such a book. I highly recommend this book.

5 out of 5 stars.
