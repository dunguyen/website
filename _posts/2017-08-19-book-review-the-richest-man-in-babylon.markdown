# The Richest Man in Babylon

The Richest Man in Babylon by George S. Clason is one of the first self-help books. Its aim is to help people manage their economy and become rich themselves.
The principles that Clason lays out are simple enough. Save some of your income, remove unnecessary expenditures, seek advice of people who know more than you, don't invest in something that you don't know anything about. 
These principles are sound and are still effective to this day.
What makes this book different is that these advice is told through Babylonian parables. The book is quite entertaining to read but these principles are told several times which makes it a bit of a slog to read through.

The book contains some very good principles to keep your money and make them work for you. It doesn't show you how which keeps it timeless. Despite this the lack of depth in this book means that there are better books out there which can help you more than this.

2 out of 5 stars.
