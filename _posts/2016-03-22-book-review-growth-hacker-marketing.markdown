# Growth Hacker Marketing
Growth Hacker Marketing by Ryan Holiday is a short primer on what a Growth Hacker is and why Holiday believes it to be the future of marketing.

First of all, this book is very short. In case you didn't read the subtitle of the book, it really is a primer. As of such it gives you an introduction to the beginnings of growth hacking and what it is. While it manages to give an overview of what a growth hacker is, it still lacks some more actionable advice. For this, read The Lean Startup.
Having already read the Lean Startup I also didn't gain that much knowledge of the subject. One interesting part was how Holiday used some techniques to write the book itself.

Give it a read if you don't know what a Growth Hacker is. Otherwise skip and move directly to The Lean Startup.

3 out of 5 stars.
