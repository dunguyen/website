# Twelve Years a Slave

Twelve Years a Slave is Solomon Northup's memoir on his time as a slave. Northup recounts the incidents leading up to his kidnapping and subsequent sale into slavery, the different masters that he had and his way out again.
Northup tells his story without any filters and it is incredible to think of he could have stayed sane and focused on getting out despite the hatred and sorrow that surrounded him.
A haunting book and reading it 150 years later after its publication I can't imagine how it must have felt like to read it in that day and age.

Highly recommended reading.

5 out of 5 stars.
