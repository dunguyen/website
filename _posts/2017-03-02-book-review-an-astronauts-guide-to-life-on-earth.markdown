# An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth
An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth by Chris Hadfield is an autobiography. Hadfield who is a Canadian astronaut and perhaps most famously known for his Space Oddity music video shot onboard ISS has written an autobiography detailing his journey to space and the lessons and principles that brought him there.

I love this book. Hadfield mixes valuable life lessons and incredible, inspiring stories about his life that really inspired me. Some of the life lessons I feel I gained most by is that even though it was his life goal to go to space, he treats this goal as a bonus to the real prize of the journey. Other amazing advice is to "sweat the small stuff", "look towards the next thing that could kill you", "maintain the attitude", "aim to be a zero" and many more. In between these he tells amazing stories about how life is at NASA, the procedures of spaceflight and that it might be a handful of people who go to space, it's only possible by the work of countless of people.

This book is extremely enjoyable to read and I found myself with a huge grin on my face while reading it. I can highly recommend this to everyone who is interested in space and even those who doubt the reason we are spending all this money for spaceflight.

5 out of 5 stars.
