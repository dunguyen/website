# Soft Skills
Soft Skills by John Sonmez is a book for software developers on everything but software. In Soft Skills Sonmez tackles everything from career advice and financial advice to fitness tips and motivation. It can, perhaps disingenuously, be described as a self-help book for software engineers.

I find the book well written. Sonmez has split the book into 7 sections and each chapter is very short. This leads to 71 chapters but each chapter reads like a blog post. This also means that each chapter is quickly read.
On the downside, the book tries to grasp over so many subjects that all of them is only casually described. For books like these, I always welcome a great bibliography but it sadly lacks a lot of sources and therefore the book sometimes comes off as being very subjective.

All in all a good entry book if you've never read a self-help book before but if you have read a few, then you can skip past this book.

3 out of 5 stars.
