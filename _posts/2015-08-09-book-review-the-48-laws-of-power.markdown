#The 48 Laws of Power
This book covers the 48 laws of power that Robert Greene has distilled from the entire world history.
The book is a godsend to the history buff as Greene carefully includes stories and tales from all over the world with emphasis on history from before the 20th century.
The language of Greene is short and precise and makes it easy to read through the book. The stories and examples are all chosen carefully to illustrate his point and the short examples makes you want to go and find out more.
All in all a very very enjoyable read and recommended to all history fans.

5 out of 5 stars.
