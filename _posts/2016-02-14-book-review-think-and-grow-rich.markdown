# Think and Grow Rich
Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill is said to have spawned the multitude of self-help books since its release in 1937. In Think and Grow Rich, Hill tries to deconstruct how people get rich. The book is a result of over 20 years of studying and interviewing the richest and most successful people in his time.

The book itself is a nice read. Hill writes in a mostly simple language which keeps the reader nicely along the points he is trying to make. There's also some few very valuable advice in the book. Principles such as controlling your mind and persisting in your goals are good advice which seems to have been validated over and over again in the course of history.

Where Hill fails is whenever he starts mentioning the way minds create waves in the universe and how two people thinking create energy in the space between them. Seemingly taken by the (by then) recent invention of the radio, Hill creates a theory of how the mind can make energy happen in the universe. He also emphasizes desire as almost being enough to become rich. These pseudo scientific claims ultimately made it very hard for me to take any of his advice seriously.

Think and Grow Rich is a self-help book which is interesting only because it spawned numerous self-help books. Time has clearly run out for this book and much better and more scientifically precise self-help books can be found. There's few universal truths here but you'll have to dig deep to find them.

2 out of 5 stars.
