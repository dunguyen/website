# Daniels' Running Formula
Daniels' Running Formula by Jack Daniels is a guide to running. Daniels is a coach who've trained countless of Olympic runners and provides principles, theory and training plans for anyone who wants to take their running to the next level.

The book itself isn't as comprehensive as I thought. There was very little mention of nutrition and race strategies but it is in the fundamentals that it excels. Daniels knows his stuff and expertly provides the simple truths about running. He also explains his VDOT system and teaches you how to create your own training plan. In a sense this is worth more because he doesn't just provide you with a sample training plan but instead teaches you to coach yourself. 

I am not sure how his plan will work out for me but even before adopting his plan, I feel like I've learned something already. Recommended for anyone who wants to start spending a lot of time running and becoming good at it.

4 out of 5 stars.
