# The War of Art
The War of Art by Steven Pressfield is the author's take on overcoming the Resistance. Steven Pressfield who normally writes fiction has ventured into the world of non-fiction with a deeply personal book. While most of the book is Pressfield explaining what the Resistance is, there are glimpses of Pressfield's personal life and struggle.

The Resistance which I have now mentioned twice without explaining what it is, is simply what keeps us from doing what we should be doing. Pressfield believes that everybody was put on Earth with something that we need to do and the Resistance is doing the utmost to keep us from doing that.
The book is divided into three books where the first is understanding Resistance, the second how to "turn pro" and win the battle against the Resistance. The third book is about finding inspiration.

The first two books are amazing and really feel motivational. With its short and sharp language the book really rouses some of fight inside you to fight against the Resistance and start achieving something. The third book was for me extremely disappointing. It is filled with personal beliefs which I have a hard time believing in myself.

The War of Art is a short book which is extremely motivating. Read the two first books and leave the third.

4 out of 5 stars.
