# Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills
Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills is nothing else but a must for any mountaineer. It is rightly considered the Bible of mountaineering and contains all the information that you would ever want to know about mountain climbing.

The book is especially easy to read considering the subjects covered. The many pictures are definitely a help and while outdoors experience is really the only way to learn mountaineering, the book is really well written. I especially like the sections on planning trips and expedition leadership, something that is often overlooked. The chapters on weather systems and geology is also fascinating to read and puts some perspective to the feat of mountaineering. The authors write with a clear and concise language with pictures added for extra comprehension.

For any aspiring mountaineer, this is a must to read. I am sure that no matter how many mountains I will climb, I can still return to this book and learn something new.

5 out of 5 stars.
