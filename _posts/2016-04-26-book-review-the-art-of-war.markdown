# The Art of War
The Art of War by Sun Tzu is the timeless classic on the manners of warfare.

The book itself is quite short but the wisdom contained in it means that it is quite a dense book to read anyway. While we may now read The Art of War and think that we know most of the things, I imagine it was simply a monumental book back then. Even now some of the passages contain immense value and many principles still apply.

The principles outlined in this book are not only applicable to ancient Chinese warfare but many can interpreted in the world today. While many of the principles regards itself on positioning and strategic decisions some other principles struck me as well. Principles such as: "To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself." and "Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays" are applicable to everyday life as well. This arguably makes it one of the rare books which transcend the domain in which it was once written in and shows us something that is fundamentally human and gives us the opportunity to improve ourselves.

4 out of 5 stars.
