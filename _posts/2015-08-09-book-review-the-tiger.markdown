#The Tiger: A True Story of Vengeance and Survival
The Tiger is the true story of a man eating tiger in the Russian Far East. It is written in this very clear and engaging style that manages to be both gripping and educational at the same time.

The thing I liked most about this book was that it not only told the story of the tiger and the hunt for the tiger but also that it covered the history of tigers in the region and tried to explain the context of a person living in the area. Some of my favorite chapters are actually about the history of the region and on the state of tigers and tiger population.

One thing I did not like was that the chapters and back and fourth in time. This means that it can be very hard to know who's who and what relation they have to each other.

Overall a quite good read and recommended for all who are interested in reading about the symbiosis of man and nature and in endangered species.

4 out of 5 stars.
