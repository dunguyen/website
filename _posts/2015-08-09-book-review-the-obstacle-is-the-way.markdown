#The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph
Fantastic book about the stoic philosophy. The book describes the stoic philosophy which manifests in the three major themes of perception, action and will. This book is a great primer to stoicism.
Ryan Holiday writes in the same style as his mentor Robert Greene and it is filled with great examples and anecdotes that supports the "lessons" in the book. The language is short and direct and the chapters are very short and digestible which makes it great as a book that you can pick up and read.
Overall a very great book and I would recommend this book along with other books by stoics.

5 out of 5 stars.
