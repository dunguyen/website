# Life of Pi
Life of Pi by Yann Martel is about an Indian boy, Pi, who gets shipwrecked with a tiger. Of course there's more to it than that. 
Life of Pi takes place in 1970's India where we get the story of Pi growing up in a zoo. The book continues with Pi ending in a shipwreck and having to share a lifeboat with a tiger. 
The way Martel tells the story is very interesting. There's the parallel story of Martel himself going to visit an older Pi who tells the story that we are now reading. There's the occasional zoology lesson interspersed and an examination of faith. All this combined with the brutality of surviving in the Pacific Ocean. All of this is told through Pi, through Martel, through Pi which makes it quite a third hand telling.
The ending is however genius as it completely flips the story on its head and you might have a revelation from it. 

Overall a great read, and be sure to catch the movie as well!

4 out of 5 stars.
