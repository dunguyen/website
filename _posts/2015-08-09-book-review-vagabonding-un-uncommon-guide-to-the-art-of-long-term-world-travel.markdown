#Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel
Vagabonding is Rolf Potts' take on long term travel. It is very important to note that it is not a guide to travel but rather a very long essay on how to lead a nomad life.

I particularly liked the parts of the book where Potts describe long term travel and what it means to be vagabonding. These parts are the most useful of the book and is a get resource when traveling.
What disappointed me about this book was the general lack of practical tips. Potts emphasizes the change in mentality one needs to have to travel but not really the small practical issues. Instead he points to other resources which he also sometimes criticizes in other parts of the book.

Overall though this book is still quite good and if only as a manifesto for travelers.

4 out of 5 stars.
