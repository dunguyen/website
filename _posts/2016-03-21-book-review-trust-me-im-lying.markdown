# Trust Me, I'm Lying
Trust Me, I'm Lying by Ryan Holiday is a book about the inner workings of media and particularly internet media. And who to know better than Holiday who was the former Director of Marketing at American Apparel where he had first-hand experience in dealing with the media and ultimately trying to manipulate it.

Holiday's writing is clear and precise and he makes no attempt to try and glorify himself. The book is written because he didn't want to participate in the toxic world of media and wishes that it could be different. This ethos shines through the book in which Holiday ruthlessly lays all of the facts bare on why today's media has lost the journalistic standard and instead trying to optimize for pageviews in order to get the ad money.

I highly recommend this book. I already had a low view of media but this book has only reinforced it and made me more adamant to keep news out of my life. Give it a read, you might feel the same way.

5 out of 5 stars.
