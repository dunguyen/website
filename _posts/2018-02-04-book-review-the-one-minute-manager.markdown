# The One Minute Manager

The One Minute Manager posits that to be a good manager, only three things are needed. 
One, clear and concise goals which are aptly named one minute goals.
Two, immediate praise with clear feedback on what was done well. Which Blanchard names one minute praisings.
Three, immediate reprimands with clear feedback on what wasn't done well and making clear that it's not personal but only work performance.

These three rules are placed in a narrative that takes up most of the pages of the book. While it keeps you reading, the rules are typically agreed upon to be universal through the narrative. So Blanchard essentially validates the theories about management that were put forth by himself. 

The book has a few merits but it definitely needs to be taken with a grain of salt. It's a quick read though, so there's that.

2 out of 5 stars.
