# Winning Without Losing
Winning Without Losing by Martin Bjergegaard and Jordan Milne is a book about the work/life balance in the context of entrepreneurs.

I really like the idea of this book. How to maintain a sense of balance in your life even though you're working to keep your company afloat or to grow it before it fails. The book is organized into 66 small essays representing 66 tips that can help you regain the balance. It is organized into seven sections: how to do things more smartly, how to do things differently than usual, how to eliminate things that waste your time and energy, how to keep moving even if life seems against you, how to design balance into your life, how to get into the mindset of balance and how to do it.

As the book is very fragmented I felt it easy and fast to read but felt it lacked a lot of elaboration on most of the subjects. The quality of each essay also varies greatly with some essays being distilled wisdom while others seem to be there to make up the numbers.

Overall it is a very interesting book. If this book had an extensive bibliography it would have been a great book but without it, it becomes a handy book instead to introduce you to some new ideas and thoughts you can try to pursue balance in work and life.

3 out of 5 stars.
