# The Revenant
The Revenant by Michael Punke is a novelization of the true events of Hugh Glass and the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. Similar to the movie, the book is completely captivating, keeping you at the edge of your seat as you read on to follow the journey of Hugh Glass. 
The amount of research that Punke did is really impressive, especially as you read the chapter on historical accuracy. Punke also manages to capture the beauty of the nature and the strenuous ordeals of Hugh Glass well, but the pace is uneven as Punke switches a lot between viewpoints, places and time. 

Overall a good book although not completely a page turner, it should provide plenty of thrills.

3 out of 5 stars.
