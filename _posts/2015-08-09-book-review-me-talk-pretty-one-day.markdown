# Me Talk Pretty One Day
Me Talk Pretty One Day is a collection of David Sedaris pieces. It is about his childhood, family, move to France and of course about himself.

While reading it I did not particular care about Sedaris. I only find a few of the pieces funny and most of it mostly just elicits a shrug from me. Some observations are pretty clever but mostly I find it to be too neurotic, sarcastic and negative for my taste.

I am sure his type of humor will make someone else laugh but this book was definitely not for me.

1 out of 5 stars.
