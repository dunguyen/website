I am a software engineer and currently employed at Microsoft. I graduated from the Technical University of Denmark in 2014 with a Masters in Digital Media Engineering. My focus was on cognitive science, user experience, machine learning and data science. Before that I had a Bachelors from the Technical University of Denmark in Software Engineering.
After graduation I worked at [Copy Me That](http://www.copymethat.com/), an online recipe manager, as an intern for 3 months. After that I had two short stints at [EasySize](http://easysize.me), a data-driven clothing sizing solution, both for two months.
